# Ant-colony-algorithm
An implementation of ant colony algorithm following this problem:
- Given a graph: distance between nodes and connections (adjacency matrix)
- Find a shortest path to traverse from a source point to a target point, and return to source point
- You could not traverse to a node twice in your path
